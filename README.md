# Project Name

nanoGPT Recreation

## Description

This project aims to recreate the functionality of nanoGPT using transformers and bilingual models. nanoGPT is a lightweight version of the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model, known for its text generation capabilities. By using transformers and bilingual models, we can achieve similar text generation results as nanoGPT, with the added advantage of language translation.

## Features

- Text generation: The project allows users to generate text based on a given prompt or context. The generated text will be coherent and contextually relevant.
- Bilingual support: The project leverages bilingual models to provide language translation capabilities. Users can generate text in one language and have it translated into another language.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mtelias2/LLM-nano-gpt`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Import the necessary modules: 
```python
import transformers
from bilingual_model import BilingualModel
```
